          <ul>
            <li>
              We reach out to men with the everlasting Gospel of the love of
              Christ, telling them about the finished work of salvation, thereby
              bringing them into the fold of his Kingdom (mark 16:15).
            </li>

            <li>
              We Teach, Preach and Demonstrate the Resurrected and Gloried
              Christ, so that the faith of the Saints should not be in the
              wisdom of men, but in the power of God. I Corinthians 2: 1-5.
            </li>

            <li>
              We teach the saints the principles of the kingdom of God, so that
              in practice of it their life can validate and influence the world
              to believe in the reality of the kingdom of God. Matthew 12:28,
              16:19
